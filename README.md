# Generating Entity Framework Core Models

### Description:

This guide outlines the steps to generate Entity Framework Core models for a database using the Scaffold-DbContext command. Before initiating the process, ensure that the required packages are installed. The steps include creating a database, executing SQL scripts, verifying table generation, and finally utilizing the Package Manager Console to generate models. Follow the instructions meticulously to successfully generate models for your Entity Framework Core project.

```shell
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer" Version="8.0.0" /> <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools" Version="8.0.0">`
```

1. Ensure that the necessary packages are installed by adding the above dependencies to your project file.
    
2. Create a database where you intend to generate models.
    
3. Right-click on the database name in your database management tool and select 'New Query'.
    
4. Paste your SQL script into the query window and execute it to create the required tables.
    
5. Verify that all tables are successfully generated in the database.
    
6. Navigate to 'Tools' -> 'NuGet Package Manager' -> 'Package Manager Console' within Visual Studio.
    
7. Paste the following command into the Package Manager Console and press Enter to generate models:
    

```shell
Scaffold-DbContext "Server=(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=your_database_name;Trusted_Connection=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models
```


Replace `your_database_name` with the name of your database. This command will scaffold the DbContext and entity classes based on the schema of your database, storing the generated models in the 'Models' directory of your project.
